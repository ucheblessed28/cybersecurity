## **Week 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity**  

### **Lesson 1: What is Cybersecurity?**  
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. It involves using technologies, processes, and practices to defend against attacks like hacking, malware, and data breaches.

### **Why is Cybersecurity Important?**  
1. **Protecting Personal and Business Data** â€“ Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.  
2. **Preventing Financial Loss** â€“ Cyberattacks can lead to stolen money, ransomware payments, and financial fraud.  
3. **Ensuring System Availability** â€“ Keeps systems running smoothly without disruption from attacks.  
4. **Protecting National Security** â€“ Governments use cybersecurity to protect critical infrastructure.

### **Lesson 2: Key Cybersecurity Concepts**  
#### **1. The CIA Triad** (Core cybersecurity principles)
- **Confidentiality** â€“ Ensuring only authorized individuals can access data. (e.g., passwords, encryption)  
- **Integrity** â€“ Ensuring data is not altered or corrupted by unauthorized users. (e.g., checksums, hashing)  
- **Availability** â€“ Ensuring data and services are available when needed. (e.g., backups, DDoS protection)  

#### **2. Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)**
- **Authentication** â€“ Verifying identity (e.g., username & password, fingerprint).  
- **Authorization** â€“ Determining what users can access (e.g., admin vs. regular user permissions).  
- **Accounting** â€“ Tracking user activities (e.g., logging who accessed a file).  

#### **3. Types of Cyber Threats**  
- **Malware** (viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware).  
- **Phishing** (fraudulent emails, fake websites).  
- **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks** (overloading a system to crash it).  
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks** (intercepting communication).  
- **Zero-day exploits** (attacking unknown software vulnerabilities).  

#### **4. Cybersecurity Careers**
Cybersecurity has various career paths, including:
- **Penetration Tester (Ethical Hacker)** â€“ Finds vulnerabilities before attackers do.  
- **Security Analyst** â€“ Monitors systems and responds to threats.  
- **Digital Forensics Expert** â€“ Investigates cybercrimes.  
- **Cloud Security Engineer** â€“ Secures cloud platforms (AWS, Azure).

## **Practical Session 1: Setting Up a Cybersecurity Lab**
We will set up a **virtual lab** to safely practice cybersecurity skills.  

### **Step 1: Install VirtualBox**
VirtualBox is a free tool that allows you to run multiple operating systems on your computer.  
ðŸ”¹ **Download**: [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)  

### **Step 2: Install Kali Linux (Ethical Hacking OS)**
Kali Linux is a Linux distribution designed for cybersecurity professionals.  
ðŸ”¹ **Download**: [https://www.kali.org/get-kali/](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/)  
ðŸ”¹ **Steps to Install:**
1. Open VirtualBox and click **New** to create a new virtual machine.  
2. Select **Linux** and **Debian 64-bit** as the type.  
3. Allocate at least **2GB RAM** and **20GB storage**.  
4. Attach the Kali Linux **ISO file** and install the system.  

### **Step 3: Install Windows Virtual Machine (Optional)**
If you want to test security on Windows, you can install a **Windows VM** using VirtualBox.

### **Assignment 1: Research Activity**
1. Search online for **real-world cyberattacks** (e.g., WannaCry Ransomware, Equifax Data Breach).  
2. Write a **short summary** of one attack:  
   - What happened?  
   - How was it prevented or stopped?  

---

### **End of Week 1 Summary**
âœ… Learned what cybersecurity is and why it is important.  
âœ… Understood key concepts like **CIA Triad, AAA, and cyber threats**.  
âœ… Installed **VirtualBox** and **Kali Linux** for hands-on practice.  
âœ… Started researching **real-world cyberattacks**.
