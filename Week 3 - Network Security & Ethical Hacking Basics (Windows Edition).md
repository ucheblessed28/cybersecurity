### **What is ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)?**  

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** is a network protocol used to map an **IP address** to a **MAC (Media Access Control) address** in a **local network (LAN)**.  

#### **Why is ARP Needed?**
Computers communicate using **IP addresses** (e.g., `192.168.1.10`), but data packets are actually sent using **MAC addresses** (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`).  
Since IP addresses are logical and can change, ARP is required to **resolve** or **translate** an IP address into a MAC address so that data can be sent correctly.

---

## **How ARP Works (Step-by-Step)**
When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same network:  

1. **The sender checks its ARP cache** to see if it already knows the MAC address for the destination IP.  
2. **If the MAC address is unknown**, the sender broadcasts an **ARP Request**:  
   - Example: *"Who has IP `192.168.1.10`? Tell me your MAC address!"*  
3. **The device with that IP responds with an ARP Reply**:  
   - Example: *"I am `192.168.1.10`, and my MAC is `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`."*  
4. **The sender stores the MAC address in its ARP cache** for future communication.  

---

## **Check ARP Entries in Windows**
Run the following command in **Command Prompt (CMD)**:
```cmd
arp -a
```
ðŸ”¹ This lists all the IP-to-MAC mappings in your ARP table.

Example Output:
```
Interface: 192.168.1.5 --- 0x8
  Internet Address    Physical Address    Type
  192.168.1.1        00-14-22-01-23-45   dynamic
  192.168.1.10       00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E   dynamic
```

---

## **Types of ARP Entries**
| Type | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Dynamic ARP** | Created automatically when a device communicates on the network. |
| **Static ARP** | Manually assigned MAC-to-IP mapping (persistent across reboots). |

ðŸ”¹ **To add a static ARP entry in Windows**, use:  
```cmd
arp -s 192.168.1.10 00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E
```

---

## **ARP Spoofing Attack**
ðŸ”´ **What is ARP Spoofing?**  
Attackers send **fake ARP replies** to trick devices into sending data to the attacker instead of the intended recipient.

**Example:**
1. The attacker sends a fake ARP message:  
   - *"I am the router (192.168.1.1), my MAC is `AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF`."*  
2. The victim updates its ARP cache with the attacker's MAC.  
3. The victim unknowingly sends traffic **through the attacker**.

âœ… **Prevention:**
- Use **ARP Spoofing detection tools** like **XArp**.  
- Enable **static ARP entries** for critical devices.  
- Use **VPNs or encrypted communication** to protect data.  

---

### **Practical ARP Scan on Windows**  
Weâ€™ll perform an **ARP scan** to list all devices connected to the local network and their corresponding MAC addresses.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Open Command Prompt**
1. Press **`Win + R`**, type **`cmd`**, and press **Enter**.
2. Type the following command to display your network configuration:
   ```cmd
   ipconfig
   ```
3. Find your **Default Gateway** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).  
   This is the IP address of your router.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Perform an ARP Scan**
Now, run:
```cmd
arp -a
```
This will list all known IP-to-MAC address mappings on your network.

**Example Output:**
```
Interface: 192.168.1.5 --- 0x8
  Internet Address    Physical Address    Type
  192.168.1.1        00-14-22-01-23-45   dynamic
  192.168.1.10       00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E   dynamic
  192.168.1.15       00-25-90-3F-7A-9B   dynamic
```
- **Internet Address** â†’ IP of devices on the network  
- **Physical Address** â†’ Corresponding MAC addresses  
- **Type** â†’ *Dynamic* (learned automatically) or *Static* (manually assigned)  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Scan the Entire Network**
You can use **ping** to scan all devices in your subnet:
```cmd
for /l %i in (1,1,254) do @ping -n 1 192.168.1.%i | find "Reply"
```
ðŸ”¹ This will ping every IP from `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254` and list the ones that reply.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Refresh and Recheck ARP Table**
After scanning, re-run:
```cmd
arp -a
```
Now, new devices that responded to the ping should appear in your ARP table.
